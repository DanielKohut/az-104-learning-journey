## üï∞Ô∏è Evolution / Naming History

## üßæ Historical Background

**Active Directory** was first introduced by Microsoft in 1999 as part of **Windows 2000 Server**, providing centralized domain management and directory services. It was further enhanced in **Windows Server 2003**, and Microsoft later released patches to make Active Directory compatible with earlier versions of Windows, including Windows 95, 98, and NT 4.0.

As Microsoft expanded into cloud technologies, **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)** emerged as the cloud-based counterpart to on-premises Active Directory. Although it is now rebranded as **Microsoft Entra ID**, many official and community documents still refer to it as Azure AD.

To bridge the gap between on-premises Active Directory and the cloud, Microsoft introduced **Azure AD Connect**, which enabled hybrid identity synchronization. This tool has also been renamed and is now known as **Microsoft Entra Connect**.


| Year | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| ~2010 | Azure Active Directory | Introduced as the identity service for Microsoft Azure |
| July 2023 | Microsoft Entra ID | Rebranded to align with the broader **Microsoft Entra** product family |

The core technology remained the same, but the **branding and roadmap evolved** to reflect Microsoft's vision of **modern identity, permissions, and secure access control**.
