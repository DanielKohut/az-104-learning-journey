# üè¢ Group Creation in Microsoft Entra ID

## üßæ Overview

**Groups** in Microsoft Entra ID are collections of users, service principals, and devices.  
Groups simplify management by allowing you to assign permissions, access to resources, and policies to a set of users instead of individually.

There are two main types of groups:
- **Security groups** ‚Äì Manage member and computer access to shared resources.
- **Microsoft 365 groups** (formerly Office 365 groups) ‚Äì Provide collaboration tools (email, SharePoint, Teams, Planner).

## üéØ Why Use Groups?
